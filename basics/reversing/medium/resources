Tips and tricks to reverse c binary:
	Use a Debugger like gdb:
		Set breakpoints and step through the code to understand its execution flow.
	Check Function Calls:
		Identify important functions and understand how they contribute to the program's behavior.
	Look for Strings:
		Examine strings in the binary; they might provide clues or reveal the flag.
	Use Static Analysis:
		Use tools like ghidra or IDA free for static analysis to visualize and understand the code.
